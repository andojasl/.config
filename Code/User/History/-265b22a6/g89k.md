### Fetch-execute cycle
Inside of computer there is a clock that executes one of the following commmands in order on each click: Fetch, Decode, Execute. In Fetch command it fetches the address of the command in RAM and puts it to __Programme Counter (PC)__. On decode command it decodes the value of the the address that was fetched before and stores it in __Intstructor Register (IR)__. On  Execute command does the operation stored in the value of the address  in RAM and stores the output in __Accumulator__.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
Stores addresses in one column and stores the value of the address in the value column. Value  column usualy  consists of two parts - instruction itself and and memory  address - adress of the unit, item that is included in the operation.
