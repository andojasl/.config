# Personal Development Report (PDR)
## Andojas Lapinskas

## Learning Goal 1
The student plans and executes and reflects on a project in their track on level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity.

### In my own words:
In this semester I aspire to complete my project in the software engineering track. I plan to achieve this by meeting the requirements set out in level 2 of the HBO-i framework. For this project I want to create a VS Code extension together with my team. I plan to contribute to achieving our goal by focusing mainly on design and implementation phases, specifically acquiring and applying a skillset in Angular, Figma and VS Code API. 

### Plan
- Week 1-5 Coming up and defining the idea. DONE [Project charter](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4s-01/blob/main/Project_charter.pdf)
- Week 6: Start researching figma, watch youtube tutorial, try building a protype. DONE [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56hs0Twfco) | [Prototype Sketch](https://www.figma.com/design/XhlTySee7MJ6YvRa23F7Ns/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=aCVtZTbV76WZHccf-0)
- Week 7: Building an initial prototype for the extension on figma. DONE [Initial Protoype](https://www.figma.com/design/TWIaTsDs83z6vyhoZsRy0a/PRJ-4?node-id=49-306&t=AZbqMm3fQdiuQHeh-1)
- Week 8: Watching typescript and angular tutorials online reading Angular documentation. [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko) | [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs) | [Angular docs](https://v17.angular.io/docs).
- Week 9: Building a dummy project by following Angular first-app tutorial to learn Angular, reading about VS Code webviews and extensions in order to understand how to use Angular in a VS Code extension. Find a template for building webview with angular. DONE [Dummy Project](https://github.com/andojasl/angular-tutorial) | [Tutorial](https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/first-app) | [webview docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) | [VS Code API docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) | [tempalate](https://github.com/4gray/vscode-webview-angular) 
- Week 10: Getting used to using Angular in the template by 4gray. Building a small demo for frontend containing the fonts and layout made in Figma prototype previously. DONE [Demo Project](https://github.com/andojasl/vs-code-angular) | [Extension tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5DX5pQ9p5M)
- Week 11: Setting up Angular framework for our extension, exploring the inner workings of Angular framework. Researching how to implement navigation in Angular. [Relevant Folder](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/tree/main/src) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5DEBMuStPw) | [Docs](https://v17.angular.io/guide/routing-overview)
- Week 12: Add VS Code styling to the extension's frontend, understand and create navigation within the application for navigating between views. [VS Code colors](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/blob/develop/src/styles.css) | [Routing Demo Project](https://github.com/andojasl/Routing-demo) | UPDATE - could not create routing using angular routing as it routes to the browser and not within VS Code webview. Although I could have done it differently, I could not find much information except of an example extension [PlatformIO](https://github.com/platformio/platformio-vscode-ide/), so I decided to instead just do one view in which you can find all components by scrolling down.
- Week 13: Create the final prototype that does not require navigation - a scrollable view with all components in it. Implement the final prototype into a VS Code webview [Final Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/TWIaTsDs83z6vyhoZsRy0a/PRJ-4?node-id=1-2&t=4FL9L5DWSgKP8Gjw-1) | [VS Code Webview](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/tree/develop/src)
- Week 14: Connecting frontend with backend functionality. Publishing the extension to github marketplace. [Github repository](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/) | [Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dahu.dahu&ssr=false#overview)

### Current level: Proficient 
##  Retrospective
Since the beginning of this project I have learned a lot about Figma, Angular and VS Code extension API, especially webviews. The working process could have been improved by not jumping ahead to practical applications and coding before before exploring relevant documentations thoroghly. If I were to complete this project once more I would focus on spending time understanding concepts rather than diving straight into action. However, with respect to Learning Goal 1, I believe I have achieved proficient level - I successfully planned and executed a project in my track, which enabled me to deepen my understanding of design and implementation by learning and applying a skillset in Figma and Angular framework.


## Learning Goal 2
The student shows professional skills on level 2 (write application, write project plan, and manage project accordingly, do a pitch, reflect personally and collaborate).

### In my own words:
In this semester I aim to consistently develop and exercise professional skills - writing, planning, pitching, collaboration and self-reflection - in order to progress in the project. I plan to achieve this goal by carefully writing and reviewing my CV and project plan, as well as an outline for my pitch. To prepare for the pitch I will also practice public speaking techniques. I will manage my time by applying time-management and productivity techniques, like Pomodoro or the Eisenhower matrix to stay on track and complete the project according to the aforementioned plan. We will make use of the Scrum development framework to collaborate efficiently. During and after the project, time will be taken to reflect on my progress towards the completion of the project and both learning goals.

### Plan
- Week 1-6: Finding idea, reaching out to stakeholders and meeting them to discuss project ideas, doing team meetings every week to discuss further steps, starting research on productivity techniques. Meeting regularly to define the idea, meeting with project coach to discuss the process, doing research on how to present, writing/presenting the pitch. Applying Pomodoro and Eisenhower techniques in my daily life in  order to improve my productivity.

- Week 7-8: Work iteratively on analysis and design artifacts, define tasks in Github project board. DONE [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/FontysVenlo/projects/376)
- Week 9-14: Write CV, improve Linkedin profile, send applications to companies. DONE [CV](https://github.com/andojasl/pdr/blob/main/Andojas_Lapinskas_CV.pdf) | [CV project on typst](https://typst.app/project/r43zUL-x2g5oBnDKGpQ9Sd)| [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andojas-lapinskas-8b6026283/) | [Application example: letter for nord security](https://github.com/andojasl/pdr/blob/main/application_letter.md) 

### Current level: Proficient 
## Retrospective
During this project, I learned how to present a pitch and manage my work better by applying the Pomodoro and Eisenhower productivity techniques. I also wrote my CV that reflects on my skills and experiences and sent multiple application letters to companies. I successfully communicated with my project group and applied the Scrum development framework to our work. We effectively planned the work on our GitHub project board, though I believe some tasks did not receive adequate attention as they turned out smaller or larger than expected. Overall, considering the scope, I believe I have reached a "Proficient" level in this learning goal. During these past 14 weeks I have significantly improved my communication, productivity and project management.
