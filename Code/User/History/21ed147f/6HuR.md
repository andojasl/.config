## Learning Goal 1
The student plans and executes and reflects on a project in their track on level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity.

### In my own words:
In this semester I aspire to complete my project in the software engineering track. I plan to achieve this by meeting the requirements set out in level 2 of the HBO-i framework. For this project I want to create a VS Code extension together with my team. I plan to contribute to achieving our goal by focusing mainly on design and implementation phases, specifically acquiring and applying a skillset in Angular and Figma. 

### Plan
- Week 1-5 Coming up and defining the idea. DONE [Idea definition](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4s-01/blob/main/Project_charter-1.pdf)
- Week 6: Start researching figma, watch youtube tutorial, try building a protype DONE [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56hs0Twfco) | [Prototype Sketch](https://www.figma.com/design/XhlTySee7MJ6YvRa23F7Ns/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=aCVtZTbV76WZHccf-0)
- Week 7: Building an initial prototype for the extension on figma. DONE [Initial Protoype](https://www.figma.com/design/TWIaTsDs83z6vyhoZsRy0a/PRJ-4?node-id=49-306&t=AZbqMm3fQdiuQHeh-1)
- Week 8: Watching typescript and angular tutorials online reading Angular documentation. [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko) | [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs) | [Angular docs](https://v17.angular.io/docs).
- Week 9: Building a dummy project by following Angular first-app tutorial to learn Angular, reading about VS Code webviews and extensions in order to understand how to use Angular in a VS Code extension. Found a template for building webview with angular. DONE [Dummy Project](https://github.com/andojasl/angular-tutorial) | [Tutorial](https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/first-app) | [webview docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) | [VS Code API docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/) | [tempalate](https://github.com/4gray/vscode-webview-angular) 
- Week 10: Getting used to using Angular in the template by 4gray. Building a small demo for frontend containing the fonts and layout made in Figma prototype previously. DONE [Demo Project](https://github.com/andojasl/vs-code-angular)
- Week 11: Setting up Angular framework for our extension, exploring the inner workings of Angular framework. Researching how to implement navigation in Angular. [Relevant Commit](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/commit/27a0833a2626e7d8d3b480a9f8fddc2f066d8e8c) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5DEBMuStPw) | [Docs](https://v17.angular.io/guide/routing-overview)
- Week 12: Add VS Code styling to the extension's frontend, understand and create navigation within the application for navigating between views. [VS Code colors](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/blob/develop/src/styles.css) | [Routing Demo Project](https://github.com/andojasl/Routing-demo) | UPDATE - could not create routing using angular routing as it routes to the browser and not within VS Code webview. Although I could have done it differently, I could not find much information except of an example extension [PlatformIO](https://github.com/platformio/platformio-vscode-ide/), so I decided to instead just do one view in which you can find all components by scrolling down.
- Week 13: Create the final prototype that does not require navigation - a scrollable view with all components in it. Implement the final prototype into a VS Code webview [Final Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/TWIaTsDs83z6vyhoZsRy0a/PRJ-4?node-id=1-2&t=4FL9L5DWSgKP8Gjw-1) | [VS Code Webview](https://github.com/mariusuktveris/dahu/tree/develop/src)
- Week 14: Connecting frontend with backend functionality. Publishing the extension. [Final code NO LINK](link) | [Extension NO LINK](link)

### Current level: Proficient 
##  Retrospective
Since the beginning of this project I have learned a lot about Figma, Angular and VS Code extension API especially webviews. I think the work could have gone better as I am too eager to start coding and made some mistakes that could have been avoided just by patiantly reading documentations and starting coding only after I understand what I need to do. If I were to do this project once again I would try to spend more time trying to understand concepts rather than diving straight into action. However considering my learning goals I believe I have achieved proficient level as I deepened my understanding of design and implementation by learning and applying a skillset in Figma and Angular framework.


## Learning Goal 2
The student shows professional skills on level 2 (write application, write project plan, and manage project accordingly, do a pitch, reflect personally and collaborate).

### In my own words:
In this semester I aim to consistently develop and exercise professional skills - writing, planning, pitching, collaboration and self-reflection - in order to progress in the project. I plan to achieve this goal by carefully writing and reviewing my CV and project plan, as well as an outline for my pitch. To prepare for the pitch I will also practice public speaking techniques. I will manage my time by applying time-management and productivity techniques, like Pomodoro or the Eisenhower matrix to stay on track and complete the project according to the aforementioned plan. Throughout the project I will maintain consistent and productive communication with my team mates to promote collaboration and awareness of the overall progress. We will make use of the Scrum development framework to collaborate efficiently. During and after the project, time will be taken to reflect on my progress towards the completion of the project and both learning goals.

### Plan
- Week 1-5: Finding idea, reaching out to stakeholders, doing team meetings every week to discuss further steps, started researching productivity techniques. [Pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) | [Pomo]
- Week 6: Meeting regularly to define the idea, meeting with project coach to discuss the process, writing/presenting the pitch. [Pitch](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4s-01/blob/main/Pitch.md)
- Project Week 1-2: Working iteratively on analysis and design artifacts, define tasks in Github project board.
- Week 8: Meeting iteratively, discussing the progress with project coach.
- Week 9-11: Working on implementation
- Project week 3-4: Finishing the final product
- Project week 5: Finishing touch if there is a need.

## Current level: Proficient 
Retrospective
At the start of this project I was at the orienting level. Since then my team and I have developed our project idea, and started working on it. We applied Scrum development framework and have, been working in iterations on analysis and design artefacts.
