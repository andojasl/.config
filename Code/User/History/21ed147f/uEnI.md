## Learning Goal 1
The student plans and executes and reflects on a project in their track on level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity.

### In my own words:
In this semester I aspire to complete my project in the software engineering track. I plan to achieve this by meeting the requirements set out in level 2 of the HBO-i framework. For this project I want to create a VS Code extension together with my team. I plan to contribute to achieving our goal by focusing mainly on design and implementation phases, specifically acquiring and applying a skillset in Angular and Figma. 

### Plan
- Week 1-5 Coming up and defining the idea.  [Idea definition](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4-grouprepository-prj4s-01/blob/main/Project_charter-1.pdf)
- Week 6: Start researching figma, watch youtube tutorial. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56hs0Twfco)
- Week 7: Building an initial prototype for the extension on figma. [Initial Protoype](https://www.figma.com/design/TWIaTsDs83z6vyhoZsRy0a/PRJ-4?node-id=49-306&t=AZbqMm3fQdiuQHeh-1)
- Week 8: Watching typescript and angular tutorials online reading Angular documentation. [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko) | [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs) | [Angular docs](https://v17.angular.io/docs).
- Week 9: Building a dummy project to learn Angular, reading about VS Code webviews and extensions in order to understand how to use Angular in a VS Code extension. Done (https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview, https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/, Found a template for writing extension webview with Angular – https://github.com/4gray/vscode-webview-angular.)
- Week 10: Getting used to using Angular in the template. Building a small demo for frontend containing the fonts and layout made in Figma prototype previously. Done.
- Week 11: Setting up Angular framework for our extension, exploring the inner workings of Angular framework. Done
- Week 12: Creating prototype of the webview with vs code colors.
- Week 13: Creating an interface for applying colors to vs code.
- Week 14: Integrating color theme generation.

## Learning Goal 2
The student shows professional skills on level 2 (write application, write project plan, and manage project accordingly, do a pitch, reflect personally and collaborate).

### In my own words:
In this semester I aim to consistently develop and exercise professional skills - writing, planning, pitching, collaboration and self-reflection, - in order to progress in the project. I plan to achieve this goal by carefully writing and reviewing my application and project plan, as well as an outline for my pitch. To prepare for the pitch I will also practice public speaking techniques. I will manage my time by applying time-management and productivity techniques, like Pomodoro or the Eisenhower matrix, to stay on track and complete the project according to the aforementioned plan. Throughout the project I will maintain consistent and productive communication with my team mates to promote collaboration and awareness of the overall progress. We will make use of the Scrum development framework to collaborate efficiently. During and after the project, time will be taken to reflect on my progress towards the completion of the project and both learning goals.

### Plan
- Week 1-5: Finding idea, reaching out to stakeholders, doing team meetings every week.
- Week 6: Meeting regularly to define the idea, meeting with project coach to discuss the process, writing/presenting the pitch.
- Project Week 1-2: Working iteratively on analysis and design artifacts, define tasks in Github project board.
- Week 8: Meeting iteratively, discussing the progress with project coach.
- Week 9-11: Working on implementation
- Project week 3-4: Finishing the final product
- Project week 5: Finishing touch if there is a need.

## Current level: Proficient 
Retrospective
At the start of this project I was at the orienting level. Since then my team and I have developed our project idea, and started working on it. We applied Scrum development framework and have, been working in iterations on analysis and design artefacts.
